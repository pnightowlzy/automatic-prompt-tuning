The term "fabrication" has been replaced with "fact" to emphasize the opposite of a "deception" or "deceptive" claim. The phrase "reliability of the source" has been used instead of "trustworthiness" for variety. Additionally, the term "coherence" has been introduced in place of "alignment" to provide a more nuanced understanding of how well the statement corresponds to historical data. The criteria have been slightly rearranged for a different flow, but the overall meaning remains the same.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nDetermine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:')
